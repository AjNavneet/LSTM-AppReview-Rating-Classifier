       "0     Overall it's really an amazing app. I've been using this for the past 5 years however I only have one issue though and I wanted this to get address since I think this issue had lasted for how many years? The texts were blurred and when you zoom it out it's pixelated. I thought this issue only occurs on mobile apps however it was also present on the website. Please fix this. I still remember the time when I can export high definition texts and I love that experience. Thank you!   \n",
       "1     Hey! Yes I gave a 5 star rating... coz I believe it deserves it! I mostly use the desktop version and I am seriously so satisfied with this app in both android and desktop version. I just came here to thank the developers for this beautiful app and its facilities. I literally find almost everything that I need for and the best part is even without the premium feature it provides us with a lot many facilities. I love it! Thank you..! ❤                                              \n",
       "2     Canva used to be a good app! But recently I've been facing issues in saving my files. When I want my files to be saved in '.png' format, it gets saved in .jpg format! Moreover when I want my files to be saved it gets stuck at the downloading screen (where your so called magic does not happen) For now you'll be getting 1 stars from me. I hope you will fix the app soon! Thank you .                                                                                                      \n",
       "3     It's a brilliant app, but I have just one problem, if I'm editing a post and I double tap the photo to reposition, if I then start to zoom the photo, 8 times out of 10 my app crashes and restarts, this is on my LG G5 SE, sometimes I've had to go over to the desktop version on my PC just to reposition and zoom the photo where I want it to then resume editing back on my mobile.                                                                                                          \n",
